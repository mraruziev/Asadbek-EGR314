## Introduction

* ****

### Project Summary

* I am responsible for mobillity of <ins>the rover project.</ins> We are team of 7 engineering students who are designing explorative rover in 4months. Please, take a look in the process of our design through different tabs and team report. IF you would like to learn more about other team member's subsystem, access team report and follow link for each member's website.
* To get more information about our team work follow Team 202 [Team report.](https://egr314-s-2026-202.github.io/)
