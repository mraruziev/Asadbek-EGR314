## Overview
Purpose of having block diagram is to help visualise my subsystem so that you can understand the workflow better. I have included 2 motors that are going to be parallel on the right. 2 motors on the left will also work together as parallel. I have planned to make the rover working with 2 motors together on each side, then making chassis as my stretch goal.

Things to mention are:
* power levels: power levels are going to be 9V for the motors, but the input to ESP 32 is 3.3V
* Actuator: I will be using 4 same DC motors for smooth operation of the rover.
* Team connections: I will be connecting my ESP32 to Caleb's board to oeprate better through RX and TX
* I Power source: barrel jack for the motors are main sources of power.
