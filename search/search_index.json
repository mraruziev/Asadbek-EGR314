The table includes threshold and target measures for each requirement. The rover's mobility is key, and ensuring that the motors and wheels support the upper body is crucial. Each requirement is important for the proper operation of my subsystem, ensuring it not only works properly but also meets EGR 314 criteria. Motor drivers require 9V, so my subsystem needs an additional power source. I have also included an additional column to show if the measure stretch requirement is met.

I have planned to make the rover working with 2 motors together on each side, then making chassis as my stretch goal. This block diagram clearly shows how power, control and data will be floweing through my subsystem and to make the whole rover system work. Mobility of the rover is crucial to successfull launch of the project.</p> <p> </p> <p>Things to mention are following: * Power levels: Unregulated power levels are going to be 9V for the motors, but the input to ESP 32 is 3.3V. For logic-level peripherals of my subsystem's ESP 32 I will use 3.3 volts.  * Actuator: I will be using 4 same DC motors for smooth operation of the rover.  * Team connections: I will be connecting my ESP32 to Caleb's board to oeprate better through RX and TX  * Power source: barrel jack for the motors are main sources of power. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#asadbeks-block-diagram","title":"Asadbek's Block Diagram","text":"<p>Showing my screenshot of the block diagram here</p> <p></p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>Microctronoller selection</p> <p>I have decided to choose the ESP32 because it has low power consumption and supports both WiFi and Bluetooth, which are needed for the motor and communication with other boards.
